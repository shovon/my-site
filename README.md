# Blog

A lot of the code is based on the default [wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) template

## Running

Although, this site uses Wintersmith, it's prefereable to use Grunt with Wintersmith.

```shell
grunt wintersmith
```

## TODO:

- soft code the hostname onto the configs. This allows Disqus to properly link to specific articles in the blog. There's also potentially other benefits as well
