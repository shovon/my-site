# My Website

This is the source code to my [website](http://shovon.github.io).

A lot of the code is based on the default [wintersmith](https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith) template.

However, the overall visual design was done by me.

## Running

Be sure that you have Node.js, Git, and Grunt installed.

If it's your first time running the system, then run the following while CD'd into the source's code folder:

```shell
$ npm install
$ grunt get
```

The above two commands installs the Node.js modules required for this project, and some CSS and JavaScript libraries I use for the site's design.

Finally, you would run:

```shell
$ grunt preview
```
